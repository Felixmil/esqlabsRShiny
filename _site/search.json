The goal is to make a design proposal that should make the use of the {esqlabR} package easier and streamlined. the esqlabR packages allow its user to model and simulate many drug effect and properties based on user’s define scenarios. These scenarios are parameterized through pre-formated excel files.\n\n\nMaterial & Methods\n\n\nResults\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\nContext"

We would be happy to discuss a design proposal for an app that could facilitate setting up such simulation scenarios and make it less error prone. Feel free to make any proposals of how this workflow can be improved. I understand that you might not have the required background experience with our type of work or the respective packages, so feel free to set up a list of questions that you as an app designer require to have answered to implement such an app.\nWe do not expect any code, but rather how you would design such an app, what features would you implement, how do you think this workflow can be improved. The package repository provides an exemplary modeling&simulation project folder (https://github.com/esqLABS/esqlabsR/tree/develop/tests/data/TestProject) with all files required to execute examples from the article.\nI hope this proposal sounds reasonable to you. Do not hesitate to contact me if you need more information!"
